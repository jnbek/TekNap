Synopsis:
   $srand(<seed>)

Technical:
   This function seeds the random number generator used by $rand().

Practical:
   This function is used to help truly randomize the client's random number
   generator.  In general, a larger seed will produce more unpredictable
   results (which is good). SET random_source determines from where we get
   the random number. 0 is from /dev/urandom, 1 is a pseudo random and 2
   based on the gettimeofday().

Returns:
   empty string

Examples:
   $srand($time())             a very large seed
