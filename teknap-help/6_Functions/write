Synopsis:
   $write(<fd> <text>)

Technical:
   This function writes the given text to the given file descriptor.  A
   newline is automatically appended to the text. The file mode has to have
   been specified in the call to open.

Practical:
   This function is useful for saving information to an external file.  It
   is most often used in scripts for saving configuration settings and the
   like.  

Returns:
     -1   if file descriptor does not exist
   > -1   number of bytes written (text length plus newline, if applicable)

Examples:
   $write(7 blah blah)                 writes "blah blah" plus NL to fd "7"
                                       if the file is in non-binary mode.
   $write(foo bar)                     "foo" not an fd, writes nothing
   $writeb(foo bar)                    "foo" not an fd, writes nothing
