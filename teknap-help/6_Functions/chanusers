Synopsis:
   $chanusers([<channel>|*] [n1 n2,n3,n4])

Technical:
   This function returns a list of users currently on the specified channel.
   It will only operate for channels that the client is currently on.
   It will alternatively return a 0 or 1 if the specified nick(s) is on the
   channel.

Practical:
   This function basically does the same thing as NAMES, except is much
   faster.  However, it only functions on the client's current channels.
   If no channel is specified, the current is used.  

Returns:
   list of nicknames on specified channel, or nothing if error

Examples:
   $chanusers()                  shows users on current channel
   $chanusers(#foobar)           shows users on foobar if client is there
   $chanusers(#foobar luna)      returns 1 or 0 if the nick is on the channel
   $chanusers(#foobar luna q)
   $chanusers(#foobar luna,q)
