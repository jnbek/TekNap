Synopsis:
   $getcap(arg)

Technical:
   This function is a general purpose interface to capabilities that 
   might be made available to the epic scripter.  Right now, the only 
   capability namespace is for termcap/terminfo.  The $getcap() function 
   takes at least one argument (the namespace) and a variable number of 
   additional arguments, depending on the needs of the namespace.

   The TERM namespace.  Usage:
          $getcap(TERM <capability name> <captype> <mangle>)
   Where "TERM" is the literal string TERM
   Where <capability name> is either a termcap capability name or a
           terminfo capability name or a "long name", as defined by
           the terminfo standard.  A list of these names can usually
           be found by 'man terminfo' if you have ncurses installed.
   Where <captype> is 0 if <capability name> is a "long name",
           is 1 if <capability name> is a "terminfo name",
           or is 2 if <capability name> is a "termcap name".
   Where <mangle> is 0 if you want the capability to be returned in
           its "raw" format, and 1 if you want control characters to
           be converted into a format suitable for use with /bind or
           for echoing to the screen.
