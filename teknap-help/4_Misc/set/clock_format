   set clock_format <text>

Description:
   This determines the format of the status bar clock. It is unset by default,
   and yields the traditional behavior until is given a value.

       %a     The abbreviated weekday name according to the  cur-
              rent locale.

       %A     The  full  weekday  name  according  to the current
              locale.

       %b     The abbreviated month name according to the current
              locale.

       %B     The  full  month  name  according  to  the  current
              locale.

       %c     The preferred date and time representation for  the
              current locale.

       %C     The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.
              (SU)

       %d     The day of the month as a decimal number (range  01
              to 31).

       %D     Equivalent  to  %m/%d/%y.  (Yecch  -  for Americans
              only.  Americans should note that  in  other  coun-
              tries %d/%m/%y is rather common. This means that in
              international context this format is ambiguous  and
              should not be used.) (SU)

       %e     Like  %d, the day of the month as a decimal number,
              but a leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU)

       %E     Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)

       %G     The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number.
              The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week num-
              ber (see %V).  This has the same format  and  value
              as  %y,  except that if the ISO week number belongs
              to the previous or next year,  that  year  is  used
              instead. (TZ)

       %g     Like  %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit
              year (00-99). (TZ)

       %h     Equivalent to %b. (SU)

              (range 01 to 12).

       %j     The day of the year as a decimal number (range  001
              to 366).

       %k     The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range
              0 to 23); single digits are preceded  by  a  blank.
              (See also %H.) (TZ)

       %l     The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range
              1 to 12); single digits are preceded  by  a  blank.

              value, or the corresponding strings for the current

              version including the seconds, see %T below.

              1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. (TZ)
