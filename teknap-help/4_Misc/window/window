Synopsis:
   window [<refnum>] [<command> [<arguments> ...]]

Description:
   The WINDOW command allows the client to display multiple "windows" of
   napster activity at once.  Some common uses for this include using
   separate windows for different channels, or for connecting to several
   servers at the same time.

   These work by splitting the screen vertically, such that there are 
   multiple panes stacked on top of one another.  Each window has its own 
   status bar, which is what separates them.

Other Notes:
   If <refnum> is given, all <commands> will be executed on that window.
