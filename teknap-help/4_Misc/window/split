Synopsis:
   window [refnum] split [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this causes the current window to use a "doubled" status
   bar with the second status bar going to the top of the screen.  In other 
   words, the status bar is two lines instead of one, allowing more 
   information to be visible at once.  Each window may have a split status
   bar independently of the rest.
