Synopsis:
   window [refnum] kill

Description:
   This destroys the current TekNap window (i.e. one created with WINDOW NEW).
   Like WINDOW DELETE, it does not make the client leave any channels it was
   on in the killed window, but it will disconnect from servers.  The last
   window left cannot be killed.
