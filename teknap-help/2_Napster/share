Description:
    The share command is used to manage the files you are willing to share
    with other napster users. Nothing is done automatically as the other
    napster clients do. After you have loaded the files, you MUST
    specifically use "-share" in order to send them to the server and make
    them available to others

        -share    used to share the files on the server.
        -load     used to load a previously saved data file of shares.
        -save     used to save a data file of shares. [~/TekNap/shared.dat]
        -unshare  unshares all files on the server.
        -remove   will remove any shares matching a pattern. Multiple
                  patterns can be specified
        -count    number of files to load from a directory
        -total    max number of files to load from specified directories
        -recurse  totals recursion of directories
        -update   attempts to update the loaded files
        -reload   scans the directories for any missing files or new files
        -type     specifies the type of files which we are going to look
                  for.
        
Examples:
    To load files from a dir:
         /share /home/mp3
    To load files from multiple dirs:
         /share /home/mp3/dir1 /home/mp3/dir2 /home/mp3/dir3
    To "share" these files:
         /share -share
