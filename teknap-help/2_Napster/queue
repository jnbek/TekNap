Synopsis:
    queue [-remove "pattern"] [-clear]
 
Description:
    Displays the download file queue. Allows removal of files from the
    queue. When we request files from a person, they have a MAX send per
    nick setting, which helps prevents bandwidth overloading. When this send
    limit is reached the sender will send a queue msg to your client, 
    causing the file to be placed in the queue. After one of the downloads
    to this person is finished, another file will be requested.

Examples:
    To display the queue:
    /queue
