Synopsis:
   browse [-direct][nick][-clear nick]

Description:
   Used to browse a "nick"'s filelist. The first time a browse command is
   issued, the server is queried about that users files. The second time the
   command is issued, then that persons files are displayed.

   You will need to clear the browse list if that persons has changed there
   filelist.
   Added support for direct browsing. Your client will connect to the remote
   client and request a list of files. This is then transmitted to the
   client. If the method is not supported, a timer of 30 seconds is used and
   a regular server browse is done.

Examples:
    To browse a persons files:
        /browse pana

    To clear a nick:
        /browse -clear pana
