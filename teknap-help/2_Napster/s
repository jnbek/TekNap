Description:
    This is the command used to find anything you happen to be looking for
    on napster. There are many options..

        -type       is used to specify a media type other than mp3 for your
                    search. It's only valid on opennap servers and clients that
                    are opennap compliant.
        -any        searches for ANY media type.
        -maxresults specifies the max search results to return. The server
                    has a MAX send results which cannot be bypassed.
        -bitrate    specifies the exact bitrate
        -minbitrate specifies the least the bitrate can be.
        -maxbitrate specifies the most the bitrate can be.
                20, 24, 32, 48, 56, 64, 98, 112, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320
        -freq       specifies the exact frequency in hz.
        -minfreq    specifies the min frequency in hz.
        -maxfreq    specifies the max frequency in hz.
                8000, 11025, 12000, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000
        -maxlinespeed
        -minlinespeed
        -linespeed  specifies the linespeed which we require for the person
                    we want to download from. A number from 0-10 is used to
                    specify the speed

Examples:
    To find a mp3:
    /search keyword
    To find a mp3 with a bitrate at least 192:
    /search -minbitrate 192 keyword
