Synopsis:
    dbsearch [[-S "filename"] [-l label] [-b bitrate] [-B bitrate] ["filename"]]

Description:
    dbsearch is used to search a mp3 database which my brother and I created
    to index our cdr's. It's a flat datafile which stores the filenames and
    directories and other pertinent information. The default location for
    this file is /etc/mp3.db which is hardcoded into TekNap. Wildcards are
    used to find what your looking for in the db. Compiled into the client
    is the "format" used to print the output to the screen.

Examples:
    To search your db for madonna:
    /dbsearch -S "*madonna*" 

Notes: 
    The standalone program is called caselogic. This command is only of use
    if you have and are using the database program.
