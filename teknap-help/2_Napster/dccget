Synopsis:
    dccget <nick(s)>

Description:
    This is a direct client to client transfer of a file. It's similar to
    irc DCC but based on napster protocols. Multiple nicks can be specified
    using ,'s between them. If /set allow_dcc is off, you can use this
    command to retrieve the offered file.

Examples:
    To send a file:
        /dccget q
        /dccget q,luna,duff
