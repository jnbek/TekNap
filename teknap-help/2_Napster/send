    This is a direct client to client transfer of a file. It's similar to
    irc DCC but based on napster protocols. Multiple nicks can be specified
    using ,'s between them. Multiple files can be sent as well. If the 
    filename is using spaces in it, it can be quoted using "'s.

Examples:
    To send a file:
        /send q test.mp3
        /send q,luna,duff "filename with space" filename2
