Synopsis:
   nslookup [-cmd { ... }] host1 [[host2] [host3] ...]

Description:
   This command will attempt to lookup a hostname, ip.
   As well you can lookup multiple hosts or ips. A alias or cmd may be 
   specified which is then performed on each. If a failure occurs, then 
   the failing name is returned, whereas on success, the name and the 
   associated ip's are returned. There is also a hook which can be used 
   only upon those nslookups without a -cmd.

Examples:
   To nslookup a ip:
      /nslookup ip

   To nslookup a ip and perform a command:
      /nslookup -cmd { echo $G $* } hostname
