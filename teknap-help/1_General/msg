Synopsis:
   msg <nickname> <text to send>
   msg <#channel> <text to send>
   msg %<process id|process name> <text to send>

Description:
   This command has 3 primary functions; to send a private message to an
   individual, to send a message to a channel, or to send a message to a
   running EXEC process (usually a command of some sort).  You can specify
   multiple recipients for the message by delimiting them with commas (but
   no spaces), and you may even mix-and-match the types of recipients.

   Additionally, there are 3 special cases for recipients.  If you specify
   a single comma, ",", the message will go to the last person who sent you a
   MSG.  If a single period, ".", the message will go to the last person you
   sent a MSG to.  If you specify an asterisk, "*", the message will go to
   your current channel.

Examples:
   To send a private message to your friend Buddha:
      /msg buddha hi there!

   To send a message to your current channel:
      /msg channel how is everyone today?

   To send a message to a running EXECed process with id 2:
      /msg %2 exit

   To send a message to an EXECed process named "mail":
      /msg %mail x

Aliases:
   When sending a message to your current channel, MSG has the same effect
   as the SAY command.
