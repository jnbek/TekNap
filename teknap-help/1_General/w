Synopsis:
   whois [<nickname>]

Description:
   The WHOIS command is used to retrieve moderately detailed information
   about the nickname(s) specified.  

   WHOIS may be used on multiple nicknames at once, provided they are
   delimited with commas.  If a server name is specified, that server will
   be queried instead of the client's current server.  If no arguments are
   given, the WHOIS will be performed on the client itself.

Examples:
   To get information on users JoeBob, ToeJam, and JuneBug:
      /whois joebob,toejam,junebug
