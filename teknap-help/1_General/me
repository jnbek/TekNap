Synopsis:
   me <action description>

Description:
   ME lets you perform an action on your current channel.  It lets you
   describe what you're doing as though someone is watching you, rather
   than you telling them.
 
Examples:
   To perform an action:
      /me doesn't want to go to work today

   Anyone on the channel you sent the action to will see something like
   this:
      * foobar doesn't want to go to work today
