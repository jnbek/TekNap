Section 1: General-Purpose Commands                                         

This section contains some of the most basic commands for TekNap. If you are
not at least familiar with these, you probably won't get very far on napster.
These commands are similar to irc commands of the same name.


Included here are commands for joining and leaving channels, connecting to
and disconnecting from napster servers, changing your nickname, sending 
private messages to other people, and countless others.

Please read this section (and the next one) carefully.  Most of the problems
encountered by new users can be solved here.
