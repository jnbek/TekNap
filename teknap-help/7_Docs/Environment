Environment Settings Relevant to TekNap                                   

Numerous environment variables are recognized by .  Environment variables are
various settings that describe your login process on a Unix system.  How they
are set mainly depends on the command shell you use.

 * For csh and tcsh shells:
      setenv variable "value"

 * For bash, ksh, and zsh shells:
      export variable="value"

 * For sh (a true Bourne shell) and ash shells, and Bourne-like shells:
      variable="value"
      export variable

 * For the rc and es shells (Plan 9 descendants):
      variable='value'

For all shells (except rc and es), either single quotes (') or double quotes
(") may be used.  For all shells, the case of the variable is significant.
Environment variables are, by convention, in all uppercase, and TekNap is no
exception.  The following variables are used by TekNap:

   NAPNICK     default nickname when connecting to a server
   NAPPASS     default password to use when connecting to a server.
   NAPSERVER   default server list, space delimited,
             serv:port:nick:pass:meta 
   NAPPORT     default server port to connect to
   NAPPATH     same as LOAD_PATH setting
   NAPLIB      path of the library of scripts.
   SHELL       shell to use
   SHELL_FLAGS shell flags for default

TekNap also uses the TERM and HOME variables, which are usually set when you
login to your Unix system.  All environment variables are available for
use inside TekNap as normal variables, assuming another variable of the same
name does not exist.

Under windows systems, the TERM variable is meaningless. However, It is
extremely helpful to setup a HOME variable using standard posix path
notation ie, //c/program files/TekNap
