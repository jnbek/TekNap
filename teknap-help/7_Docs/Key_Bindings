How to Use Key Bindings in TekNap                                            

One of the strengths of this client is its /bind command.  It permits any
key or sequences to keys to be bound to any arbitrary action.  You are most
likely already familiar with using keyboard shortcuts with other programs.

The general allowable key sequences that may be bound are as follows:

   Sequence   Description                                                   
   c          any single character may be bound (case sensitive)
   ^c         any letter (case insensitive) may be bound as a control key,
              as well as any of:  ? [ ] \ ^ @
   METAn-c    any meta key (1..9) may be used in conjunction with a single
              key (as in the first form, above)
   METAn-^c   meta keys (1..9) may also be used in conjunction with control
              keys (as in the second form, above)
   mc         this is another form of using meta keys, except in this case
              the key bound to a META function is specified
   m^c        same as above, except used in conjunction with control keys

Meta keys may also be bound to other meta keys, such that a sequences may
be several characters in length.  Some examples:

   Whenever the '|' key is typed, the client will try to use that nick:
      bind | parse_command nick |

   This lets ^X (control-x) be used as a meta key in other bindings
      bind ^X meta2_character

   Either of these can be used to switch to a new window:
      bind meta2-w next_window
      bind ^Xw next_window

   Either of these can be used to switch back to the previous window
      bind meta2-^W previous_window
      bind ^X^W previous window

   A binding can also use a block of commands:
      bind ^^ {
         echo 1
         echo 2
      }

   The client uses these bindings automatically for the arrow keys
      bind ^[ meta1_character
      bind meta1-[ meta2_character
      bind meta2-A backward_history        /*    up arrow */
      bind meta2-B forward_history         /*  down arrow */
      bind meta2-C backward_character      /*  left arrow */
      bind meta2-D forward_character       /* right arrow */

      ^W -       - Shrinks  
      ^W +       - Grows current  
      ^W m       - Moves current  
      ^W l       - Lists  
      ^W k       - Kills  
      ^W h       - Hides  
      ^W b       - Balances  
      ^W n       - Swaps  
      ^W p       - Swaps  
      ^X         - Switch channels
      ^U         - clear line to cutbuffer
      ^Y         - copy line from cutbuffer
      ^K         - join last invited channel
      ^A         - beginning of line
      ^B         - bold color
      ^D         - delete character
      ^H         - backspace
      ^I         - tabkey expansion
      ^J         - send line
      ^L         - refresh screen
      ^M         - send line
      ^N         - quote literal char
      ^P         - backward history 
      ^Q         - quote character
      ^S         - toggle stop screen
      ^T         - transpose characters
      ^V         - reverse color
      ^W         - meta 2
      ^Z         - stop nap
      ^_         - underline
