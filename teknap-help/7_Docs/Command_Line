Command Line Usage of TekNap                                                  

The TekNap napster client has a number of options available to it from the 
command line.  The basic command-line syntax is:

   TekNap [<switches>] [<nickname> [<server list>]]

The nickname may be at most 30 characters long.  The server list may be a
space-delimited list of server addresses.  Each server name may use the
server:port notation if a port other than the default (usually 8888) is
desired.  The available switches are as follows:

   -r <file>  loads a list of server from specified file
   -a         add default servers and command line servers to server list
   -n <nick>  nickname to use
   -p [pass]  password to use
   -N         No auto-connect to a server
   -v         print the client's version string and exit
   -C         create the account
   -S <num>   number of the server to connect to

Unlike other Unix programs, switches for TekNap cannot be combined. 
Something like "-db" is not allowed, "-d -b" must be used.
