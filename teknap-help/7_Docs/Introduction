Crash Course in irc with TekNap                                               

You are using the TekNap napster client.  Assuming you have the correct help
files for your client.  TekNap is a based on BitchX/EPIC and ircII clients.

TekNap offers a staggering number of features, far too many to describe here.
Instead, this document will show you the basics you'll need to get started
with napster and with TekNap.

All commands in TekNap are prefixed with a '/'.  This is called the command
character, and is used to distinguish typed commands from messages intended
for a channel.  Here are some basic commands that you should become familiar
with.  In these examples, do not actually include the <> characters when you
enter the command.

   /help <n> <topic>   This is the single most important command available
                       in this client.  If you don't know what a command
                       does, chances are it is documented in the online
                       help.  When all else fails, look here.  The 'n' is
                       a section number, and 'topic' is the command to
                       get help on.  If you use /help by itself, a list
                       of sections is given.

   /join <channel>     This makes you join the specified channel.

   /part <channel>     This makes you leave the specified channel.

   /msg <someone>      This lets you send a private message to the specified
                       nickname.

   /server <server>    This lets you switch to a new napster server.

   /whois <someone>    This will give you some information about the given
                       nickname.

   /names <channel>    This shows you a list of everyone on the specified
                       channel.  You will automatically see a listing for
                       any channel you join.

   /list               This lets you list all the channels on your napster
                       network.

These commands should be sufficient to get you started.  If you want to learn
more about TekNap, reading the online help is a good way to start.  If you 
have questions about napster in general, join one of the napster help channels
 on efnet and ask someone.  On EFnet, the channel is #napster.
