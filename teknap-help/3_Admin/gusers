Synopsis:
   gusers <*|servername> [-elite|-admin|-moderator|-leech|-cloak|-muzzled|
                           -ip  #|-channel #channel|-cmd { }]
Description:
   Shows all users with the specified level on either ALL servers or on the
   specified server. WARNING this can be a large list! If -ip is used, it
   can be a specific ip or a range of ips. Using /24, /16, /8 for masking or
   255.255.0.0 is the only accepted method. Wildcards are not valid. Flags
   can be used together. For -cloak and -channel at least 2 characters of
   the command must be specified. A specific command maybe performed on the
   returned nicks, ALOT of care must be given or you could conceivably kill
   all your clients on the server.

Examples:
   /gusers * -admin

   To display all users on the server group with AOL address:
   /gusers * -ip 172/8  [equivalent to 172/255.0.0.0]

   To display all users using AOL on channel #alternative:
   /gusers * -ip 172/8 -channel #alternative

   To mass kill by ip range:
   /gusers * -ip 172/8 -cmd { kill $0 }
