<sheiker> *desperr* wanna code stuff into bwap for me?
          <[04:18]:despair@lex-ts2-25.iglou.com>
<sheiker> -> *desperr* Oh, whatcha looking for? <[04:19]>
<sheiker> *desperr* i thought it would be really cool if i could set up a
list
          of music that i am looking for
<sheiker>           <[04:19]:despair@lex-ts2-25.iglou.com>
<sheiker> *desperr* and have it autosearch those people when i connect to a
          server and return a list
<sheiker>           <[04:19]:despair@lex-ts2-25.iglou.com>
<sheiker> *desperr* instead of having to search for each of the things i
like
          every time i connect to a server
<sheiker>           <[04:19]:despair@lex-ts2-25.iglou.com>
<sheiker> *desperr* it would make bwap elite++++
