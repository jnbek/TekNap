Version 0.01 Server Link Guidelines/Application.


  If you agree with the following guidelines your application will be
subjected to a vote of the server owners. There is one vote allowed per
server and a proxy vote may be used. If your application for a link is
accepted, you will have a 30 day period in which no new
Moderators/Admins/Elites must be added. At the end of the 30 days, your
performance on the network will be evalutated. If for some reason, it has
been found to be lacking, then an immediate de-link will occur. ANY
information you might gain from being a Moderator/Admin/Elite must be kept
confidential, abuse of your priveledge will be immediate grounds for a
de-link. 

  If your server is linked, you will be required to keep your server
code upto date with the most recent code versions. A CVS repository is
available in order todo this.

  When new Moderators/Admins/Elites are added, ALL members are to be
notified before the user is upgraded. Any objections to this person are to
be handled by an admin who must make an appeal to the owners on why this
person should not have Moderator status. Elites will have final say on a
Moderator/Admin.
