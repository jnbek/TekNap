       There is no main file header in an MPEG audio file. An MPEG audio
       file is built up from a succession of smaller parts called frames.
       A frame is a datablock with its own header and audio information.
           In the case of Layer I or Layer II, frames are some totally
       independent items, so you can cut any part of MPEG file and play
       it correctly. The player will then play the music starting to the
       first plain valid frame founded. However, in the case of Layer
       III, frames are not always independant. Due to the possible use of
       the "byte reservoir", wich is a kind of buffer, frames are often
       dependent of each other. In the worst case, 9 frames may be needed
       before beeing able to decode one frame.
           When you want to read info about an MPEG audio file, it is
       usually enough to find the first frame, read its header and assume
       that the other frames are the same. But this is not always the
       case, as variable bitrate (VBR) files may be encountered. In a VBR
       file, the bitrate can be changed in each frame. It can be used, as
       an exemple to keep a constant sound quality during the whole file,
       by using more bits where the music need more to be encoded.
           The frame header is 32 bits (4 bytes) length. The first eleven
       bits (or first twelve bits in the case of the MPEG 2.5 extension)
       of a frame header are always set to 1 and are called "frame sync".
           Frames may have an optional CRC checksum. It is 16 bits long
       and, if it exists, follows the frame header. After the CRC comes
       the audio data. By re-calculating the CRC and comparing its value
       to the sored one, you can check if the frame has been altered
       during transmission of the bitstream.
           Here is a presentation of the frame header content. Characters
       A to M are used to indicate different fields. In the table below,
       you can see details about the content of each field.

   Note: MPEG Version 2.5 was added lately to the MPEG 2 standard. It is
   an extension used for very low bitrate files, allowing the use of
   lower sampling frequencies. If your decoder does not support this
   extension, it is recommended for you to use 12 bits for
   synchronization instead of 11 bits.

   "free" means free format. The free bitrate must remain constant, an
   must be lower than the maximum allowed bitrate. Decoders are not
   required to support decoding of free bitrate streams.
   "bad" means that the value is unallowed.
   MPEG files may feature variable bitrate (VBR). Each frame may then be
   created with a different bitrate. It may be used in all layers. Layer
   III decoders must support this method. Layer I & II decoders may
   support it.
   For Layer II there are some combinations of bitrate and mode which are
   not allowed. Here is a list of allowed combinations.

   G 1 (9) Padding bit
   0 - frame is not padded
   1 - frame is padded with one extra slot
   Padding is used to exactly fit the bitrate.As an example: 128kbps
   44.1kHz layer II uses a lot of 418 bytes and some of 417 bytes long
   frames to get the exact 128k bitrate. For Layer I slot is 32 bits
   long, for Layer II and Layer III slot is 8 bits long.
   H 1 (8) Private bit. This one is only informative.
   I 2 (7,6) Channel Mode
   00 - Stereo
   01 - Joint stereo (Stereo)
   10 - Dual channel (2 mono channels)
   11 - Single channel (Mono)
   Note: Dual channel files are made of two independant mono channel.
   Each one uses exactly half the bitrate of the file. Most decoders
   output them as stereo, but it might not always be the case.
       One example of use would be some speech in two different languages
   carried in the same bitstream, and then an appropriate decoder would
   decode only the choosen language.
   J 2 (5,4) Mode extension (Only used in Joint stereo)
   
   Mode extension is used to join informations that are of no use for
   stereo effect, thus reducing needed bits. These bits are dynamically
   determined by an encoder in Joint stereo mode, and Joint Stereo can be
   changed from one frame to another, or even switched on or off.
   Complete frequency range of MPEG file is divided in subbands There are
   32 subbands. For Layer I & II these two bits determine frequency range
   (bands) where intensity stereo is applied. For Layer III these two
   bits determine which type of joint stereo is used (intensity stereo or
   m/s stereo). Frequency range is determined within decompression
   algorithm.
   Layer I and II Layer III

   K 1 (3) Copyright
   0 - Audio is not copyrighted
   1 - Audio is copyrighted
   The copyright has the same meaning as the copyright bit on CDs and DAT
   tapes, i.e. telling that it is illegal to copy the contents if the bit
   is set.
   L 1 (2) Original
   0 - Copy of original media
   1 - Original media
   The original bit indicates, if it is set, that the frame is located on
   its original media.
   M 2 (1,0) Emphasis
   00 - none
   01 - 50/15 ms
   10 - reserved
   11 - CCIT J.17
   The emphasis indication is here to tell the decoder that the file must
   be de-emphasized, ie the decoder must 're-equalize' the sound after a
   Dolby-like noise supression. It is rarely used.
