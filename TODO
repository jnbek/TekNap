*** News 06/22/Y2K -- Numeric parameters available in /wait %cmd and /exec
-end
        When you are inside a /wait %cmd {...} or /exec -end {...} body, the
        following numeric parameters are available:
                $0 - The name or number of the exec'd process
                $1 - The signal (if any) that killed the process
                $2 - The return code (if any) of the procss
        This is exactly the same as what you get inside /on exec_exit.
