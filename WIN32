Alot of confusion with the Win32 version of TekNap. So here comes a
explanation.

Because TekNap is unix based, we use a unix emulator (cygwindevo.dll) to
provide some of the things needed by TekNap. This also makes various things in
TekNap weird for you non-DOS users. 

We require a HOME directory. This is automatically provided under unix
systems, but DOS it is not. So edit your c:\autoexec.bat file and add the
following. You can use notepad or a DOS editor called edit todo this.

edit c:\autoexec.bat

set HOME=//c/TekNap

and save the file. You will need to reboot the system for the changes to
take effect.

You can setup several other required variables in your autoexec.bat.

set NAPNICK=Your_Nick
set NAPPASS=Your_Pass
set NAPSERVER="bitchx.dimension6.com:8888:::0
	some.other.server:8888:another_nick:some_other_pass:0"
(not the server line is ALL on one line, and not split over two lines,
multiple servers are separated by spaces)

Once you've edited the autoexec.bat file, save it and then reboot your
system. This is so that the variables are loaded and become available for
TekNap to use.

[Scripts]

teknap.rc  which is placed in the HOME directory will be auto-loaded on
           startup of the client. You can have any command you like within
           this file, including the "load" command for loading other
           scripts. The HOME directory will usually be c:\TekNap unless
           you happened to set a HOME directory in your autoexec.bat file.

You can also load scripts from the TekNap command line using the load
command. Use this for temporary scripts that you do not run all the time.

	/load //c/TekNap/script.rc
	/load ~/script.rc

The above two commands are equivalent. ~ translates to HOME which in most
cases will be c:\TekNap, unless you set a HOME variable in autoexec.bat.
