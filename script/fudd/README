This is a set of scripts I wrote for TekNap (formerly BWap). They do a range 
of things including nick completion, auto-response, fixed tabkey support, and
a wide  variety of stuff for Moderators and higher. I wrote everything except
the nick completion which was written by shade for a BitchX/EPIC script I
wrote a while back.

HOW TO USE THESE SCRIPTS

In order for these scripts to do anything, they must be loaded into the
client's memory. This can be done with the /load command. Since each of
these scripts is independent of the others, you have the choice of loading
only the features you want. This can be done at any time from within the
client by typing "/load <filename>".

  Examples:

	/load /home/you/.TekNap/scripts/oper
	/load $HOME/scripts/floodprot
	/load ~/.TekNap/scripts/away
	/load scripts/misc

Most people don't want to have to type this every single time they start
BWap. So loading the scripts automatically on startup through the .teknaprc
file is usually the best way to go. This can be done a couple of different
ways..

  UNIX users put the following in ~/.teknaprc
  Windows users put the following in c:\TekNap\teknap-rc or teknap.rc

  Windows users also do not have a ~/.TekNap directory so I recommend
  something like c:\TekNap (//c/TekNap)

	Method 1:

	load ~/.TekNap/scripts/autoresponse
	load ~/.TekNap/scripts/away
	load ~/.TekNap/scripts/floodprot
	  ...

	---

	Method 2:

	fe (autoresponse away floodprot oper) file
	{
		load ~/.TekNap/scripts/$file
	}

	---

  The sample.bwaprc file included demonstrates method 2.

WHAT'S IN THE SCRIPTS

Just a note, the global variables (the ones in CAPS) that I will be using
throughout these scripts can be changed using the /assign command. At some
point I may write an interactive config, but until then, everything has to be
done on the fly using /assign or in the scripts themselves.

*autoresponse*

  This script makes the nick of anyone saying something with
  $AUTO_RESPONSE_STR in it, yellow.

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    AR_BEEP			0/1		Auto-response beep ON/OFF
    AUTO_RESPONSE		0/1		Auto-response ON/OFF
    AUTO_RESPONSE_STR		text string	What triggers Auto-response

*away*

  Your standard away system including public away notification and msg
  logging.

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    AWAY_LOG			0/1		Msg logging ON/OFF
    AWAY_LOGFILE		filename	Away logfile
    DEFAULT_AWAY_REASON		text string	Default away reason
    DEFAULT_BACK_REASON		text string	Default back reason
    PUBLIC_AWAY			0/1		Public away notice ON/OFF
    PUBLIC_AWAY_CHANNELS	channel list	Channels to notify. If this
						variable does not exist, all 
						channels are notified.

  Commands:
    /away [reason]		- Sets you as away for [reason]
    /back [reason]		- Sets you as not away for [reason]
    /readlog			- Read your away msgs
    /remlog			- Remove logfile

*bans*

  A whole bunch of ban related stuff.

  Commands:
    /ban <nick1|IP1,nick2|IP2,...> [reason]	- Places ban(s)
    /bankill <nick1,nick2,...> [reason]		- Places a ban and then
						  kills each nick specified
    /banlist					- Display the server banlist
    /bans					- Same as /banlist
    /bk	<nick> [reason]				- Add channel ban and kick
    /cban <channel> <nick> [reason]		- Add a channel ban
    /cbanclear <channel>			- Clear a channels banlist
    /cbanlist [channel]				- List a channels bans
    /ctban					- Interactive channel ban remove
    /cunban <channel> <ban1> [ban2] ...		- Remove channel bans
    /tban					- Interactive server ban remove
    /tempban <seconds> <nick|IP> [reason]	- Temporary ban for <seconds>
    /unban <nick1|IP1> [nick2|IP2] ...		- Remove ban(s)

*floodprot*

  Standard flood protection.

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    AUTO_IGNORE_TIME		# of seconds	How long to ignore the flooder
    FLOOD_PROTECTION		0/1		Flood protection ON/OFF

  Commands:
    /fprot [0|1|off|on]			- Toggle flood protection
    /ignore [nick]			- Add [nick] to ignore list
    /unignore [nick]			- Remove [nick] from ignore list

  If you want to change what exactly triggers a flood, try /set flood in BWap

*functions*

  Some (un)useful functions. 

  Functions:
    checkuserclass(<nick>)	- Checks <nick>'s user class and returns a #
				  accordingly.
    fparse(<fset> <args>)	- Doesn't currently work.

*misc*

  Miscellaneous stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else.

  Commands:
    /cme <text>			- Sends an action with colored text
    /csay <text>		- Sends a public with colored text
    /cycle [channel]		- Leaves then re-joins a channel
    /links			- Shortcut for /admin links
    /lusers			- Shortcut for /admin stats
    /partall			- Part ALL your current channels
    /pingme			- Pings yourself
    /q				- Shortcut for /query
    /quote			- Shortcut for /raw
    /sv				- Shortcut for /version
    /wi <nick1> [nick2] ...	- Perform a whois lookup on nick(s)

  Also included is a fix for Auto-rejoin on channel kick and on channel
  clear. Works with BWap's internal /set AUTO_REJOIN

*nickcomp*

  Auto-completes people's nicknames when addressing them in public channels.
  This was borrowed from my BitchX/EPIC4 script playdough. It was originally
  written by shade <shade@chemlab.org>.

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    NICK_COMP			0/1		Nick completion ON/OFF
    NICK_COMP_CHAR		character	Character to use with nick
						completion

  This is triggered when the first word you send is followed by a ":". For
  example..

  Users on channel Lobby: You, Friend, SomeGuy

  Typing "fri: hi!" would send "Friend: hi!"
  Typing "omeg: you are lame" would send "SomeGuy: you are lame"

*oper*

  A bunch of stuff for Moderators+

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    AUTO_MUZZLE			0/1		Auto-muzzle ON/OFF
    AUTO_MUZZLE_TIME		# of seconds	Duration of muzzle
    OPERVIEW_SIZE		# of rows	Determines size of OperView
						window

  Commands:
    /automuzzle [0|1|off|on]		- Toggles auto-muzzle
    /c <0|1|2|3|4>			- Sets current channel's level to <#>
    /clones [server]			- Checks for clones
    /mkill <string> [reason]		- Mass kills everything matching
					  <string>. Accepts wildcards.
    /operview				- Toggles OperView
    /ov					- Same as /operview
    /tmuzzle <seconds> <nick> [reason]  - Temporarily muzzles <nick> for
					  <seconds>
    /u <nick> [level]			- Changes <nick>'s level to [level]

  Note: If Auto-muzzle is enabled then the public flood protection will not
        ignore anyone flooding, but will attempt to muzzle them instead.

*tabkey*

  This was just an attempt to fix BWap's broken msg history. Without this
  script BWap only keeps track of the last nick that msg'd you. This allows
  you to keep track of an unlimited amount of nicks.

  Config Variables:		Value:		Description:
    MAX_MSG_BUFFER_SIZE		#		How many nicks to keep in
						the msg history

  Just press your Tab key to use this. Note: loading this script will
  disable all other tabkey functions such as filename and command completion.

*window*

  Some very simple, but useful, window related aliases.

  Commands:
    /swap [winnum]		- Swap to a different window
    /wc				- Create a new hidden double statbar window
    /wj <channel>		- Creates a new window (/wc) and joins <channel>
    /wk				- Kills the current window
    /wl				- Shortcut for /window last
    /wn				- Shortcut for /window next
    /wp				- Shortcut for /window previous


That's it for now.. I'll try to keep this file updated as often as possible.
Let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for these scripts.

These scripts are updated frequently so remember to check my webpage from
time to time..

Enjoy..
