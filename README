TekNap 1.3g_3
This version has been patched and will compile on GCC versions up to 4.6.2
with craptons of warnings; by the port maintainer, (I presume) for the FreeBSD port.
Compilation on Arch Linux with GCC 4.6.2 succeeded up until the link point, with errors
with pthreads, so you must pass --disable-threads in configure to compile on Linux.

Errors on Linux with pthreads:

term.o: In function `pthread_equal':
/usr/include/pthread.h:1139: multiple definition of `pthread_equal'

One of these days, I might fix this, anyone is welcome to do so.

Environment Variables.

Each of these can be exported before running BXnap.
	NAPNICK your default nick
	NAPPASS your default pass
	NAPSERVER a server list
	NAPPORT the metaserver port to use.

the serverlist is in the following format.

	servername:port:nick:password:usemeta

	opennap.fortyoz.org::blah:hrm:1

	opennap.fortyoz.org:8888:blah:hrm

Upon startup a ~/.teknaprc is search for and loaded. Within that file you can
have various commands.. Under windows this file would be called teknap.rc
and more than likely be in your c:\TekNap directory.
	ex.
	server +add server.name:port:nick:password:meta


TekNap [flags] [server] [nickname]

	-N		do not autoconnect to a server
	-r filename	load filename list of server.
	-a		add servers, to not overwrite.
	-n		nickname to use
	-p		password to use [not advisable to use this]
	-C		create user account.


I'd like to thank all those that have contributed time and code to the TekNap
project. Some of this code is taken from BitchX/epic irc clients.
