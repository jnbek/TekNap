	*** UNOFFICAL CHANGES *** - Spike
	Hopefully someone can get back into the TekNap spirit and continue
	this wonderful legacy. I have been doing some spotted work for the
	client, but when I finally get better at coding hopefully I can do
	much more to fix many problems that need to be fixed, such as stuff
	that exists in the TODO file. I've named this release TekNap-1.4u,
	where the 'u' refers to an unoffical version. If anyone has any
	better ideas or would like to help, please let me know. I do wish
	Colten Edwards would get back into the TekNap code and help fix
	the remaining errors, but we all realize that he does have a family
	to take care of, as well that he never has much time to himself even.
	Even so, we do thank him for the work he did put into this wonderful
	client. :)

May 10th, 2004
	Fixed compile errors when using the latest GCC 3.4.0

Aug 23rd, 2003
	Fixed some varibles so that TekNap-1.4 now compiles with GCC 3.3

Feb 10th, 2003
	Changed copyright date in configure script from 2000/2001 to 2003.

	Fixed configure script issue rerunning autoconf, rerunning autoconf on
	systems with newer autoconf versions will break the configure script.
	If you must run autoconf, execute the autogen.sh script yourself.
	You will need the older autoconf installed to do this successfully.

	Fixed "Memory Usage" string in server stats to show proper memory
	usage on opennap-ng servers. Since older opennap versions this feature
	was broken, not only broken in TekNap, but in the opennap code as well.

	Changed internal date from 20000909 to 20011011. Since November 11th
	2001 was the last offical update for TekNap. Not October 9th 2000.

	Fixed the "Unexpect pong" typo. "Unexpected pong" is where its at!

	Patched in newly updated Napigator server list download code, since
	the boys at Napigator changed the layout, the -A switch works again. :)

	Updated napster.txt file with the more informative one from teknap.com.

	*** OFFICAL CHANGES ***

Oct 11th, 2001
	Added RAW_IRC support as requested. This will allow you to grab
	the incoming raw irc commands and do something with them. Added
	a couple of necessary compiler defines for OSX/darwin.. no libcrypt
	or libresolv however.

	Added Support for new napster login methiod. Changed serverio
	to use big-endian and spoof the v2.0 beta10.3 login abilities
	To use, start TekNap with -c switch

	to both a server reference number and a raw socket number

	from www.napigator.com and place it in the server list of TekNap. As
	Well auto-connect is turned off. The /set default's are used for
	nick and password. 
	
	/server -save added to save a list of your current servers. This
	list is reloaded upon startup. Due to restrictions, the password is
	not encrypted, therefore should not be used on a shell for mod+
	users
	
	Fixed new browse method so it doesn't block (oops).
	
	Added ability for /gusers to use a -cmd {} which is performed on the
	matches

	this to the strftime() format you would like.

	supporting multiple types.

	Added generic_handler() for the napster msg's which should be
	handled but have not real specific handler.

	Added support for new Napster direct client browse.. Also a /set
	DEFAULT_DIRECT_BROWSE. /browse -direct [nick] will toggle the value.
	Added ALLOW_DCC_OVERWRITE on/off. More checking on files about to be
        dcc'd to you.

	Added private DCC CHAT support using /chat [nick] [password].

	Encryption is really simple xor and not some super duper

	in the -l line

	/set status_format1 /set status_format2
	chanusers() modified to accept a nick to check for on a channel.

	Added /debug and /set debug with documentation.

	Fixed $channelnicks() to search the windows for the channel.
	Reinstated my clear() when we start curses in scott.c because:
        /* I know pana removed this before, but I have to have this clear(),
         * Or else my Win95 Securecrt -> Linux -> "screen" (TERM=ansi)
         * does not clear the non-curses text correctly. -Sheiker
         */

	Because I was very annoyed at having to type /scott -search,
	instead of /scott -se<enter>
	I decided to change /scott slightly.
	I have now expanded scott.c to be 3 commands in 1.
	1) /ssearch<enter>  This will automagically go to your
		search list. No BS typing of -search.
	2) /sbrowse nick<enter> This will automagically go to your
		browse nicks. No way to do -search here.
	3) /scott <nick or -search><enter>. The old way of doing
		things, just in case you are too hardcased to switch
		commands after all this time. =) -Sheiker
