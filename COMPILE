Below are some "Trouble" OS's, and how to compile TekNap under them.


---Compiling under Solaris Sparc 2.6/2.7/2.8---

Troubles galore with native compiler. Luckily with Solaris Sparc
there is a software site with all the gnu utils precompiled.
Go to http://www.sunfreeware.com/ and get gcc. Just pkgadd -d
the gcc package.
Once you have that install, run the TekNap's ./configure script.
When its done, go modify the TekNap/Makefile and add
-DSOLARIS to the CFLAGS line.
Compiling will give lots of warnings, but it will compile fine.
For some reason with curses on Solaris Sparc, the normal TERM
entries like "ansi" and "vt100" do NOT display colors. You MUST
use TERM=dtterm; export TERM to get /scott to display colors.


---Compiling under HPUX 10.20 and 11---

Troubles galore with native compiler, and native "make".  You really
just *have* to bite the bullet and install gcc and gmake.
Once you get a working a working gcc and gmake, run ./configure
in the TekNap directory. Now, my HPUX box does NOT have threads
installed, but for some reason, include/defs.h has WANT_THREAD
defined. You MUST go #undef WANT_THREAD. At this point, you should
get a clean compile, and the binary will run.
For some reason, curses does NOT detect that our terminfo supports
color. So you will not get color, I recommend TERM=dtterm for use
on HPUX.


---Compiling under Sco Unix Openserver 5.x---

Troubles galore with native compiler, and native "make".
Luckily Sco has all the "gnu" utils precompiled in a package they
call "Skunkware".
Go to http://www.sco.com/skunkware/ To get gcc and make.
Once you have them installed, the rest should go flawless for you.
TERM=scoansi and TERM=vt100 both give us the colors we want in /scott


---Rhapsody 5.5---

for some reason, threads are detected in the libc. however there doesn't
appear to be threads in the c library. so in "config.h", turn off #define
THREADS, also turn off #define SCOTT, as the ncurses.h on this OS wants to
include curses.h. This leads to bad things.
